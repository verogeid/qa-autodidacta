Welcome to your English audiobook for IT professionals.

In this session, you will practice common phrases and structures used in daily meetings like stand-ups or sync calls.
You will learn to speak about your progress, blockers, and plans.

Let’s begin with key phrases. Repeat after me:

Yesterday, I fixed a bug. [pause]  
Today, I will write new tests. [pause]  
I’m waiting for a pull request. [pause]  
I had a problem with the API. [pause]  
I will ask for help. [pause]  
I don’t have any blockers. [pause]  
Everything is working fine. [pause]  
I need to check the logs. [pause]

Now answer the following questions aloud:

What did you do yesterday? [long pause]  
What are you doing today? [long pause]  
Do you have any blockers? [long pause]  
Do you need help from the team? [long pause]
