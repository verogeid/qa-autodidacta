Welcome to your English audiobook for IT professionals.

This session focuses on explaining how you manage blockers and delays in your work.  
This is key in interviews and real team communication.

Useful phrases. Repeat after me:

I’m currently facing a blocker. [pause]  
The issue is out of my scope. [pause]  
I’ve already flagged it to the team. [pause]  
We’re waiting for input from the dev team. [pause]  
I’ve documented the issue in Jira. [pause]  
I always try to unblock myself before escalating. [pause]  
Clear communication helps avoid misunderstandings. [pause]

Example answer (repeat slowly):

When I face a blocker,  
I first try to analyze if I can solve it independently.  
If not, I check the documentation and recent commits.  
Then I contact the developer or lead and explain the issue clearly.  
Meanwhile, I switch to other tasks so I don’t waste time.  
I always document the situation in Jira to keep the team aligned.
